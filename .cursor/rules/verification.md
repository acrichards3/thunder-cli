## Code Verification Requirements

After making any code changes, you MUST verify that the code passes all quality checks before considering the task complete.

### Mandatory Verification Steps:

1. **Check for Linting Errors**:
   - Use the `read_lints` tool to check for any linting errors in the files you modified
   - If linting errors are found, fix them immediately before proceeding
   - Run `bun run lint` to verify the full linting pipeline passes

2. **Verify Build Passes**:
   - Run `bun run build` or the appropriate build command to ensure the project builds successfully
   - Fix any build errors before considering the task complete
   - Ensure all TypeScript compilation passes without errors

3. **Type Checking**:
   - Verify TypeScript type checking passes with `bun run typecheck`
   - Fix any type errors that arise from your changes

### Rules:

- **Never skip verification**: Always verify linting and builds pass after making changes
- **Fix errors immediately**: If linting or build errors are found, fix them as part of the same task
- **Use available tools**: Use `read_lints` tool to check for linting errors in modified files
- **Complete verification**: Don't consider a task done until all checks pass

### Expected Behavior:

When you make code changes:

1. Make the requested changes
2. Check for linting errors using `read_lints` on modified files
3. Fix any linting errors found
4. Verify the build passes (run `bun run build` if needed)
5. Only then consider the task complete

If you introduce errors, you must fix them before marking the task as done.
