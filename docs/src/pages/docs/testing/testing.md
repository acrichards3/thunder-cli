# Testing

Vex App uses [Bun's built-in test runner](https://bun.com/docs/test) — no Jest, Vitest, or any other framework needed. Tests are written with `describe` and `it` from `bun:test` and run with a single command.

If you opted into the AI settings during project setup, your AI agent will automatically follow these testing conventions — including the WHEN/AND structure, `.spec.ts` file naming, and all the rules below. The Cursor rules and ESLint overrides enforce these patterns so the agent writes tests the same way you would.

## Running Tests

```bash
bun run test
```

Run tests for a specific workspace:

```bash
bun run test:backend
bun run test:frontend
bun run test:lib
```

## Test File Convention

Test files use `.spec.ts` (not `.test.ts`) and are co-located next to the source file they test:

```
features/
  users/
    users.controller.ts
    users.controller.spec.ts
    users.actions.ts
    users.actions.spec.ts
    users.service.ts
    users.service.spec.ts
```

## Test Structure — WHEN / AND / it

Tests are structured as a decision tree that mirrors the code paths of the function being tested. Every branch in the source code maps to a branch in the test.

### The Pattern

1. **Top-level `describe`** — the function or endpoint being tested
2. **`describe("WHEN ...")`** — a condition or input scenario
3. **`describe("AND ...")`** — a deeper branch when paths diverge further
4. **`it("does X")`** — the leaf assertion, only at the end of a path

Continue nesting `AND` blocks until every code path has been covered.

### Example

Given this action that applies a discount to an order:

```typescript
const applyDiscount = (order: Order, code: string): Order => {
  const discount = findDiscount(code);

  if (!discount) {
    throw new Error("Invalid discount code");
  }

  if (discount.expiresAt < new Date()) {
    throw new Error("Discount code has expired");
  }

  if (order.total < discount.minimumSpend) {
    throw new Error("Order does not meet minimum spend");
  }

  return {
    ...order,
    discount: discount.amount,
    total: order.total - discount.amount,
  };
};
```

The test maps every branch:

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect, beforeEach } from "bun:test";

describe("applyDiscount", () => {
  describe("WHEN the discount code does not exist", () => {
    it("throws an invalid discount code error", () => {});
  });

  describe("WHEN the discount code exists", () => {
    describe("AND the code has expired", () => {
      it("throws a discount expired error", () => {});
    });

    describe("AND the code has not expired", () => {
      describe("AND the order total is below the minimum spend", () => {
        it("throws a minimum spend error", () => {});
      });

      describe("AND the order total meets the minimum spend", () => {
        it("returns the order with the discount applied", () => {});

        it("reduces the total by the discount amount", () => {});
      });
    });
  });
});
```

Each path through the source code gets a `WHEN` or `AND`, and each leaf gets an `it`. When a test fails, the full describe path reads like a sentence: `applyDiscount > WHEN the discount code exists > AND the code has not expired > AND the order total is below the minimum spend > throws a minimum spend error`.

## Rules

### One assertion per `it`

Each `it` block should verify exactly one behavior. If a test needs multiple assertions, split them into separate `it` blocks. This way, when a test fails, the name tells you exactly what broke.

### `it` descriptions start with a verb

Use "returns", "throws", "creates", "updates", "deletes", etc. Avoid vague names like "works correctly" or "handles edge case".

### No logic in `it` blocks

No `if/else`, loops, or try/catch inside `it`. If a test needs branching, it should be separate `it` blocks under different `WHEN`/`AND` describes.

### Setup goes in `beforeEach`

All test setup belongs in `beforeEach` blocks. `it` blocks should only execute the action being tested and assert the result. Teardown goes in `afterEach`.

### No shared mutable state

Each test must be independent. `beforeEach` should reset everything. No test should depend on another test having run first.

### Test real behavior

Do not mock your own code just to make tests pass. If you can run it, run it for real. Mocks are only acceptable when:

- The dependency is an external API or third-party service you cannot control
- The real thing has side effects that cannot run in tests (sending emails, processing payments)
- You need to simulate a specific failure condition (network timeout, DB connection refused)
